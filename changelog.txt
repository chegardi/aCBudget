Changelog

SUNDAY JUNE 21st 2015
*	Improved the backend of update command to utilize SQLite functionality - improving performance. Also fixed a minor bug occuring when assigning 'type' to the new line of an update.
*	Also removed automatic backup of database when program is ended properly. Backup must be done manually by the user through config menu.
*	Reordered a lot of code to be within CCodingStandard at: <a>http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eno/coding/CCodingStandard.html</a>

WEDNESDAY MAY 27th 2015
*	Extended 'update' command to be able to update either combinations of "comment, type, amount" before possible insertion of second entry.
*	Updated read from either DNB or Sparebanken Sør files to store the number of lines read, for easy "continue from last time" after program is shutdown. Also some minor alterations in the procedure of reading/storing DNB lines.
*	Updated License with full name.

MONDAY MAY 18th 2015
*	Added backup functionality. Program automatically creates a backup file of current database, and adds two new commands within 'config' to backup to- or revert from backup database.

THURSDAY APRIL 7th 2015
*	Fixed a bug in 'insert' command when trying to execute statements after first statement often lead program to crash.
*	Added a detailed_readme.txt which explains the program in more detail including how the database should be set up.

MONDAY APRIL 6th 2015
*	Divided source files in '/src' into different files with headers for each, for better readibility and maintainabilty.
*	Implemented an update command for easier update of existing rows, with additional possibility of adding a new entry with new comment, type and amount on same date as updated (a sort of "split" function).
*	Added functions "numbered_callback", "decreasing_callback", "update" and "get_update_command" and some variables in header to use in the update command described in previous point.
*	Removed "print" as a command on help display, as there is no such command.
*	Added a warning in '''select''' command that ALL statements will be executed, as well as a confirmation of input for any sql statements other than "select". This will hopefully improve security against accidentally executing unintended statements on database.

WEDNESDAY APRIL 1st 2015
*	Fixed a bug in function "configurate(..)" which would lead to config variable update resulted in NULL value.
*	Reverted method 'tempnam()' back from 'mkstemp()' for ability to execute in Windows environment. Advice you who are using this program to store it in a non-admin folder on a non-system disk.

MONDAY MARCH 31st 2015
*	Removed and updated some comments in 'acbudget.c'
*	Replaced method 'tmpnam()' to 'mkstemp()' in acbudget.c after warning from compiler. Warning is fetched from tempnam:notes:
	"""Although tempnam() generates names that are difficult to guess, it is nevertheless possible that between the time that tempnam() returns a pathname, and the time that the program opens it, another program might create that pathname using open(2), or create it as a symbolic link. This can lead to security holes.  To avoid such possibilities, use the open(2) O_EXCL flag to open the pathname.  Or better yet, use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3)."""
*	Replaced "char* filename" by a constant in header "char* CONFIG_FILENAME", which is set to default 'config.ini' in function 'configuration()'.
*	Renamed "char* select(char *command, sqlite3 *database)" to "char* myselect(char *command, sqlite3 *database)" because of name-conflict in "select.h"

Changelog

WEDNESDAY APRIL 1st 2015
*	Fixed a bug in function "configurate(..)" which would lead to config variable update resulted in NULL value.
*	Reverted method 'tempnam()' back from 'mkstemp()' for ability to execute in Windows environment. Advice you who are using this program to store it in a non-admin folder on a non-system disk.

MONDAY MARCH 31st 2015
*	Removed and updated some comments in 'acbudget.c'
*	Replaced method 'tmpnam()' to 'mkstemp()' in acbudget.c after warning from compiler. Warning is fetched from tempnam:notes:
	"""Although tempnam() generates names that are difficult to guess, it is nevertheless possible that between the time that tempnam() returns a pathname, and the time that the program opens it, another program might create that pathname using open(2), or create it as a symbolic link. This can lead to security holes.  To avoid such possibilities, use the open(2) O_EXCL flag to open the pathname.  Or better yet, use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3)."""
*	Replaced "char* filename" by a constant in header "char* CONFIG_FILENAME", which is set to default 'config.ini' in function 'configuration()'.
*	Renamed "char* select(char *command, sqlite3 *database)" to "char* myselect(char *command, sqlite3 *database)" because of name-conflict in "select.h"
